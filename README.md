# KanbanBoard
Full-Stack React: Kanban Board

Authentication with JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) is crucial for full-stack applications, as it provides a secure and scalable method for verifying user identities. JWTs are compact, URL-safe tokens that encode a user's authentication data, allowing servers to authenticate requests. Additionally, JWTs can include metadata and be easily verified and decoded, enhancing security while enabling seamless authentication across various parts of an application.

User Story:

AS A member of an agile team
I WANT a Kanban board with a secure login page
SO THAT I can securely access and manage my work tasks

Acceptance Criteria:

GIVEN a Kanban board with a secure login page
WHEN I load the login page
THEN I am presented with form inputs for username and password

WHEN I enter my valid username and password

THEN I am authenticated using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and redirected to the main Kanban board page

WHEN I enter an invalid username or password

THEN I am presented with an error message indicating that the credentials are incorrect

WHEN I successfully log in

THEN a JWT is stored securely in the client's local storage for subsequent authenticated requests

WHEN I log out

THEN the JWT is removed from the client's local storage and I am redirected to the login page

WHEN I try to access the Kanban board page without being authenticated

THEN I am redirected to the login page


WHEN I remain inactive for a defined period

THEN my session expires, the JWT is invalidated, and I am redirected to the login page upon my next action
